## Building and installing

The build dependencies for this VMOD can be found in CI, but briefly:
```
varnish-dev
libcurl4-openssl-dev
libpcre3-dev
libarchive-dev
```

This VMOD does not have an installation procedure. Simply build it from source, and copy the final `libvmod_*.so` into your VMOD folder (usually `/usr/lib/varnish/vmods/`):
```sh
./build.sh
```
Or manually:
```sh
# Create a .build folder and build the VMOD in it
mkdir -p .build
pushd .build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DVARNISH_PLUS=OFF
make -j6
popd

# Copy VMODs into Varnish VMOD folder
sudo cp .build/libvmod_*.so /usr/lib/varnish/vmods/
```

If during building you are seeing errors with a Python script, try setting the Python 3 executable directly using a CMake define:
```sh
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DVARNISH_PLUS=OFF -DPython3_EXECUTABLE=$(which python3)
```

There is a build-merge-release CI system that currently only builds for Ubuntu 22.04:
