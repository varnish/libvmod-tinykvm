 * During the start of the program, one should register functions that will
 * handle different types of requests, like GET, POST and streaming POST.

 *  int main()
 *  {
 *  	printf("Hello World\n"); // Will be logged
 *  	set_backend_get(my_request_handler);
 *  	wait_for_requests();
 *  }
 *
 * The example above will register a function called 'my_request_handler' as
 * the function that will get called on every single GET request. When the
 * main body is completed, we call 'wait_for_requests()' to signal that
 * the program has successfully initialized, and is ready to handle requests.
 *
 * Register callbacks for various modes of operations:

/**
 * Storage program
 *
 * Every tenant has a storage program that is initialized separately (and in
 * the same way as the main program) at the start. This program has a ton
 * of memory and is always available. Both the main and the storage programs
 * are running the same original program provided by the tenant at the start,
 * but they can diverge greatly over time.
 * To access storage you can use any of the API calls below when handling a
 * request. The access is serialized, meaning only one request can access the
 * storage at a time. Because of this, one should try to keep the number and
 * the duration of the calls low, preferrably calculating as much as possible
 * before making any storage accesses.
 *
 * When calling into the storage program the data you provide will be copied into
 * the VM, and the response you give back will be copied back into the request-
 * handling VM. This is extra overhead, but safe.
 * The purpose of the storage VM is to enable mutable state. That is, you are
 * able to make live changes to your storage VM, which persists across
 * requests. You can also serialize the state across live updates so that it
 * can be persisted when you have program updates. And finally, it can be
 * saved to a file (with a very specific name) on the servers disk, so that
 * it can be persisted across normal server updates and reboots.
