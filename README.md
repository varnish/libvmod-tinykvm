# VMOD KVM and TinyKVM

The TinyKVM VMOD processes data in Varnish at native performance using your servers CPU capabilities safely with sandboxing.

Choose the fastest libraries, ones that may not be battle hardened. Or those that aren't available in distro packages, or libraries that solve problems in different/novel ways that lead to performance under specific conditions. Put them in a program, build once, and then __use it forever__.

For example Varnish beresp.do_gzip:
```
Requests/sec:   2273.37
Transfer/sec:     60.97MB
```
TinyKVM sandboxed libdeflate:
```
Requests/sec:   3695.62
Transfer/sec:     99.04MB
```

## Documentation

You can find the complete [VMOD documentation here](docs/README.md).

## Demonstration

```sh
KVM_GID=$(getent group kvm | cut -d: -f3) docker compose up
```

## Building and installing

The build dependencies for this VMOD can be found in CI, but briefly:
```
varnish-dev
libcurl4-openssl-dev
libpcre3-dev
libarchive-dev
libjemalloc-dev
```

This VMOD does not have an installation procedure. Simply build it from source, and copy the final `libvmod_*.so` into your VMOD folder (usually `/usr/lib/varnish/vmods/`):
```sh
./build.sh
```

With Varnish Enterprise:
```sh
./build.sh --enterprise
```

Or manually:
```sh
# Create a .build folder and build the VMOD in it
mkdir -p .build
pushd .build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DVARNISH_PLUS=OFF
make -j6
popd

# Copy VMODs into Varnish VMOD folder
sudo cp .build/libvmod_*.so /usr/lib/varnish/vmods/
```

If during building you are seeing errors with a Python script, try setting the Python 3 executable directly using a CMake define:
```sh
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DVARNISH_PLUS=OFF -DPython3_EXECUTABLE=$(which python3)
```

There is a build-merge-release CI system that currently only builds for Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04:

[Packages here](https://github.com/varnish/libvmod-tinykvm/releases).

### Example VCL

```vcl
vcl 4.1;
import tinykvm;
backend default none;

sub vcl_init {
	# Download and activate a Varnish-provided library of compute programs.
	# A full list of programs and how they can be used would be on the docs site.
	tinykvm.library("https://filebin.varnish-software.com/tinykvm_programs/compute.json");

	# Tell VMOD compute how to contact Varnish (Unix Socket *ONLY*)
	tinykvm.init_self_requests("/tmp/tinykvm.sock");
}

sub vcl_backend_fetch {
	# Fetch a JPG image from a remote server
	tinykvm.chain("fetch",
		"https://filebin.varnish-software.com/tinykvm_programs/spooky.jpg",
		"""{
			"headers": ["Host: filebin.varnish-software.com"]
		}""");
	# Transcode JPG to AVIF
	set bereq.backend = tinykvm.program("avif", "", """{
		"speed": 10,
		"quality": 35
	}""");
}
```
